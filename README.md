## Name: Untitled Dating Sim

## Functionality
Our prototype centers around the main loop of the game. With this we are able to allow the user to input and save their
name. From there they are shown a map(of buttons) of the character's locations and they can choose who to go on a date with. 
The date aspect(aka, the minigames) of our game is not currently implemented as we are still coming up with more ideas.
After this the player has the choice of stopping after the third date. (not sure if we want to set a cap on the max number of dates)
Later on the affection points gained or lost in the minigames will be implemented. 
The last part of the loop is when the player chooses their favorite character thus ending the game. 
We also still need to implement the save and restart functionality.
For the tests, they all passed at one point but occasionally the system tests fail for some unknown reason. But rest assured
they all had a green check at some point (we have proof, if you would like it).

## Prototype
Running the prototype is very easy.
Simply run it :) and input/click your choices. The settings button in the top corner is clickable! :D
