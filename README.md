## Name: Untitled Dating Sim

## Functionality
Our prototype centers around the main loop of the game. With this we are able to allow the user to input and save their
name. From there they are shown a map(of buttons) of the character's locations and they can choose who to go on a date with. (The game
currently has three working minigames or date options.) After this the player has the choice of stopping after the third date. The amount of 
affections points each character will have for you depend on your minigame results. You gain one point for every game that you lose and win 5 
points if you win the Trivia or Riddle Game. If you win the Kissing game, you gain 10 affection points. 
The last part of the loop is when the player chooses their favorite character thus ending the game. The player's progress (affection points) will
be saved throughout the game unless you restart or start a new game, in that case everything resets back to 0.
For the tests, they all passed at one point but occasionally the system tests fail for some unknown reason. But rest assured
they all had a green check at some point! In that same vein, the kissing game tests fail sometimes because of the random nature of the selecting
a minigame. 

Note - We are leaving the sound and music buttons located in the settings pop out menu. Although they are not functional at the moment,
we will revisit and implement them at a later date. Same with original artwork, the placeholder images will remain for this submission and 
will be changed later.
