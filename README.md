# CMPU-203 F23 - Team 1G

## Name: Untitled Dating Sim

## Functionality
Our prototype centers around the main loop of the game. With this we are able to allow the user to input and save their
name. From there they are shown a map(currently a list of string locations) of the character's locations and they can choose who to go on a date with. 
The date aspect(aka, the minigames) of our game is not currently implemented as we are still coming up with more ideas.
After this, the player can go on as many as 9 more dates, while also having the choice of stopping after the third date.
All of the responses that are inputted have to be the same as the one's we wrote. Since this is a text based prototype and 
in the later stages of the game this part will mostly happen through screen interactions we chose to keep it simple and not account for 
outliers. In a similar vein, later on the affection points gained or lost in the minigames will be implemented. 
The last part of the loop is when the player chooses their favorite character thus ending the game. 
We also still need to implement the save and restart functionality.

## Prototype
Running the prototype is very easy. It's in the UserInterface class which has the main() method and instructions.
Simply run it :) and input your choices (they have to be exactly right tho)


## Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

## Contributing
State if you are open to contributions and what your requirements are for accepting them.

For people who want to make changes to your project, it's helpful to have some documentation on how to get started. Perhaps there is a script that they should run or some environment variables that they need to set. Make these steps explicit. These instructions could also be useful to your future self.

You can also document commands to lint the code or run tests. These steps help to ensure high code quality and reduce the likelihood that the changes inadvertently break something. Having instructions for running tests is especially helpful if it requires external setup, such as starting a Selenium server for testing in a browser.

## Authors and acknowledgment
Show your appreciation to those who have contributed to the project.
